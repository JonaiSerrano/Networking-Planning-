# Network Infrastructure Design Project
## Project Overview
This project outlines the network infrastructure design for Greenfield Properties, a company that is in the process of setting up its IT network. The design includes decisions regarding network architecture, cable types, server needs, and network scalability, with a focus on ensuring secure and efficient operations for both in-house and remote employees.
## Key Components
- **Network Architecture**: The choice between a client/server or peer-to-peer network based on the company’s size and objectives.
- **Cable Types**: Recommendations for the appropriate cabling (coaxial or twisted pair) to connect in-house hosts to the network switch or router.
- **Servers**: A breakdown of the necessary servers, including whether they should be on-premises, cloud-based, or hybrid.
- **Operating Systems**: The operating system(s) selected for the servers (Windows Server or Linux) and the rationale for the choice.
## Purpose and Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design a network that:
- Supports Greenfield Properties' expected employee base and devices.
- Implements a reliable network architecture for both in-house and remote access.
- Provides scalable and secure network solutions for future growth.
- Ensures the company’s servers, cables, and operating systems align with industry best practices for performance and security.
